-- Disable hardcoded Port Taverna 7-day rule that conflicts with Phase 2 is_active repurposing
-- 
-- ISSUE: Migration 20250801185028_apply_7_day_active_rule.sql specifically targets Port Taverna
-- and applies the OLD semantics (is_active = 7-day login activity) which conflicts with our
-- Phase 2 repurposing where is_active = settlement membership.
--
-- This migration overrides that hardcoded rule to align with the new Phase 2 architecture.
