# Bitsettler - Cursor AI Rules (Auto-loaded)

## MANDATORY: Read and Follow Project Governance
- ALWAYS read and strictly follow CURSOR_GOVERNANCE.md
- This file contains complete project governance rules
- Ask before editing ANY files not explicitly mentioned
- Show diffs and get approval before making changes

## Edit Permission System
- Default: ASK FIRST before editing anything
- Only edit files in zones explicitly approved for current work
- Database changes: ONLY via Supabase CLI workflow
- Authentication system: Read-only unless explicitly allowed

## Session Start Checklist
1. Read CURSOR_GOVERNANCE.md
2. Ask what specific area I'm working on today  
3. Only open files explicitly mentioned
4. Confirm edit permissions for current work scope

## Quick Reminders
- Architecture: Data → Page → View pattern
- Authentication: All settlement features require auth
- Database: Supabase CLI only, never direct edits
- TypeScript: Strict mode, fix errors don't ignore
- Security: Never bypass auth or permission checks

Follow CURSOR_GOVERNANCE.md for complete rules and context.
