- [x] Settlement permissions display (inventory, build, officer, co-owner)
- [x] Activity timeline (join date, last seen)
- [x] Top skills ranking with visual progress bars
- [x] Navigation breadcrumbs and back buttons

### 🏗️ Next.js 15 Compatibility
- [x] Fixed async params in App Router

- [x] Updated API routes for Next.js 15 patterns

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Polling/Caching Architecture (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)

### 🗄️ Database Schema & Infrastructure
- [x] `settlements_master` table and sync logging
- [x] `settlement_members` and `settlement_citizens` tables
- [x] `settlement_member_details` view for optimized queries
- [x] Auto-updating top profession triggers
- [x] Sync logging and audit trails

### 🔄 Data Synchronization Services
- [x] Settlement master list sync (every 30 minutes)
- [x] Member and citizen data sync (every 20 minutes)
- [x] Rate limiting and API etiquette
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] Sync orchestration service

### 📡 API Architecture Implementation
- [x] **Dashboard API**: 3-tier fallback (Local DB → Demo Data)
- [x] **Members List API**: 3-tier fallback (Local DB → Demo Data)  
- [x] **Member Detail API**: Cache-only (Local DB → 404 if not cached)
- [x] **Settlement Search API**: 2-tier (Local DB → BitJita API)
- [x] Eliminated real-time BitJita API calls from user-facing endpoints
